28.4.7 Current Sensor Wiring and Calibration

The current sensor detects the amount of current flowing through the motor. We use a PCB
breaking out the MAX9918 current-sense amplifier and an onboard 15 m current-sense
resistor, as described in Chapter 21.10.1.

In this section, you will first use the information in Chapter 21.10.1 to set up and calibrate
your current sensor, independent of the NU32 and the motor. The questions refer to the circuit
in Figure 21.22.

1. Choose the voltage divider resistors R3 to be a few hundred ohms (e.g., 330 ).

Ok, then, let R3 = 330Ohms

_____

2. Find the maximum current you expect to sense. If the H-bridge’s battery voltage is V and
the motor resistance is Rmotor, then the maximum current you can expect to see is
approximately Imax = 2V/Rmotor. This occurs when the motor is spinning at no-load
speed in reverse, with essentially zero current and −V across the motor terminals,

−V = ktωrev → ωrev = −V/kt

and then the control voltage switches suddenly to V, yielding (ignoring inductance)

V = ktωrev + ImaxRmotor → Imax = 2V/Rmotor.

Record your calculated Imax for your battery and motor.

H-bridge we are using: DRV8835
Per the datasheet, the voltage supply to the DRV8835 can be up to 11V
Reasonably, V will never be more than the supplied battery voltage 6V

In lecture, we found the motor resistance to be ~6 Ohms
Imax = 12V/6Ohms = 2 Amps

_____

3. Calculate the voltage across the 15 mOhm sense resistor if Imax flows through it. Call this
Vmax.

Vmax = IR = (2 Amps) (15 mOhms) = 30 mV

4. Choose resistors R1 and R2 so the current-sense amplifier gain G = 1 + (R2/R1)
approximately satisfies

1.65 V = G × Vmax.

This ensures that the maximum positive motor current yields a 3.3 V output from the
current sensor and the maximum negative motor current yields a 0 V output from the
current sensor, utilizing the full range of the ADC input. Choose R1 and R2 to be in the
range of 10^4-10^6 .

G = 1.65V/Vmax
G = 1.65V/ 30mV = 55

Let R1 = 10k Ohms
1 + R2/R1 = 55
R2 = 54 * R1
R2 = 540,000 Ohms
R2 ~ 530,000 Ohms. We can make this with a 330k Ohm resistor in series with
two 100k Ohm resistor.

_____

5. Choose a resistor R and a capacitor C to make an RC filter on the MAX9918 output with a
cutoff frequency fc = 1/(2πRC) in the neighborhood of 200 Hz, to suppress
high-frequency components due to the 20 kHz PWM.

Let C be a 104 capacitor, or 10*10^4 nF, or 10^-7 F

fc = 1/(2piRC)
R = 1 / (2piCfc)
R = 1/(2pi)/(10^-7 F) /200Hz
R = 8000Ohms ~ 10k Ohms

Using R = 10k Ohms and C = 10^-7 F, we get a cutoff
frequency Fc = 1/(2pi)/(10^-7 F)/(10k Ohms) = 159Hz



can't do this yet bc current sense resistor is giving too-high values



_____

6. Build the circuit as shown in Figure 21.22, but do not connect to the motor or the PIC32.
You will calibrate the circuit using resistors, an ammeter, and an oscilloscope or voltmeter.
Figure 28.7 shows how to use a resistor R0 to provide controlled positive and negative test
currents to the current sensor. You will choose different values of R0 to create test currents
over the range of likely currents. For example, if you have two 20 resistors, you can use
them to create an R0 of 20 , 40 (two resistors in series), or 10 (two resistors in
parallel). If the battery voltage V is 6 V, this results in expected currents of ±300, ±150,
and ±600 mA, respectively.


Important: The calibration resistors must be rated to handle high currents without
burning up. For example, a 20 resistor with 300 mA through it dissipates
(300 mA)2(20 ) = 1.8 W, more than a typical 1/4 W resistor can dissipate.



cannot do this yet because we're using the INA219, not the MAX9918



_____

With different resistances R0, use an ammeter to measure the actual current and a
voltmeter or oscilloscope to measure the output of the current sensor. Fill out a table
similar to the table below, for your particular resistances and battery. If you
built your current sensor circuit correctly, zero current should give approximately 1.65 V
at the sensor output, and the data points (sensor voltage as a function of the measured
current) should agree with the amplifier gain G you designed. If not, time to fix your
circuit.

R0 ( ) 	   | Expected I (mA) Measured I (mA) Sensor (V) ADC (counts)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
10 (to RS+)|               |                |          |            |  
20 (to RS+)|               |                |          |            |   
40 (to RS+)|               |                |          |            |   
Open circuit 0 0 1.63
40 (to RS−) |              |                |          |            |
20 (to RS−) |              |                |          |            |
10 (to RS−) |              |                |          |            |


Leave the column “ADC (counts)” blank; you will fill in that column in the next section.
As a sanity check, you can replace R0 with your motor, stalled, and make sure that the
sensor voltage makes sense.
