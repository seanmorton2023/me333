6.9. Edit Code Sample 6.3 so that each line correctly uses the “bits” forms of the SFRs.
In other words, the left-hand sides of the statements should use a form similar to that
used in step 5, except using INTCONbits, IPC0bits, and IEC0bits.

16. Modify Code Sample 6.2 so the USER button is debounced. How can you change the
ISR so the LEDs do not Rash if the falling edge comes at the beginning of a very brief,
spurious down pulse? Verify that your solution works. (Hint: Any real button press
should last much more than 10 ms, while the mechanical bouncing period of any decent
switch should be much less than 10 ms. See also Chapter B.2.1 for a hardware solution
to debouncing.)
