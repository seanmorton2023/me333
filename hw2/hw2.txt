3. Pin 12 of the PIC32MX795F512H can serve as a:
	- analog input, like to sensors and potentiometers
	- comparator input,
	- change notification input, and cause an interrupt if an input changes,
	- digital input, and
	- digital output.
	
	This pin is not 5V-tolerant, per the diagram.

4.	The name of the SFR you need to modify in order to change
	pins on PORTC from output to input is TRISC. Specifically
	we need to change bits in TRISC from 0 to 1 to change pins
	from output to input.

6. Basic function of items in the PIC32 architecture:
	- SYSCLK: "system clock", the clock input the CPU runs on
	- PBCLK: "peripheral bus clock", used to clock instructions
		to peripherals
	- PORTA: missing on our version of the PIC32
	- PORTB to PORTG: digital i/o pins
	- Timer1 to Timer5: count the number of pulses of a signal
		and can be used to count up to 2^16 - 1
	- 
	
	[ talk about which pins can be used as analog in port a-g ]
	
	- 10-bit ADC: can read analog voltages from up to 16 pins and 
		convert them to digital signal values
	- PWM OC1-5: used to create either a single pulse or a continu-
		ous pulse train with a certain duration and frequency
	- Data RAM: quick-access memory used to store temporary data
	- Program Flash Memory: a large amount of slow-access memory
		used to store program instructions
	- Prefetch Cache Module: stores recent program instructions
		and prepares the next instruction to be requested by the 
		CPU to increase speed of execution

7. Peripherals not clocked by PBCLK: PORTA through PORTB ae clocked
	by SYSCLK and the USB peripheral runs on USBCLK.

8. A 10-bit ADC can detect up to 2^10 = 1024 different values of V.
	For voltages between 0 and 3.3V, these values are separated
	by 3.22 mV. Therefore ~3.22mV is the largest voltage difference
	that the microcontroller may not be able to detect.

9. The PIC32 family reference manual says "The 16-line cache supplies
	an instruction every clock, for loops up to 256 bytes long."
	This seems to imply that a program loop up to 256 bytes in size 
	can be completely stored in the cache.

10. The data path between the prefetch cache module and the flash
	memory is 128 bits wide so that it can provide the same band-
	width to the CPU as a 32 bit wide path running at 4x the
	frequency.
