Chapter 24.1.2, 24.2.1 and 2, 24.3.1 and 2.

24.1 Wiring and Testing the Circuit
1. LED diode drop. Connect the LED anode to 3.3 V, the cathode to a 330  resistor, and
the other end of the resistor to ground. This is the LED at its maximum brightness. Use
your multimeter to record the forward bias voltage drop across the LED. Calculate or
measure the current through the LED. Is this current safe for the PIC32 to provide?

2. Choose R. Wire the circuit as shown in Figure 24.2, except for the connection
from the LED to OC1. The LED and phototransistor should be pointing toward each
other, with approximately one inch separation, as shown in Figure 24.4. Now choose R to
be as small as possible while ensuring that the voltage Vout at the phototransistor emitter is
close to 3 V when the LED anode is connected to 3.3 V (maximum LED brightness) and
close to 0 V when the LED anode is disconnected (the LED is off). (Something in the
10 k range may work, but use a smaller resistance if you can still get the same voltage
swing.) Record your value of R. Now connect the anode of the LED to OC1 for the rest of
the project.

24.2 Powering the LED with OC1
1. PWM calculation. You will use Timer3 as the timer base for OC1. You want a 20 kHz
PWM on OC1. Timer3 takes the PBCLK as input and uses a prescaler of 1. What should
PR3 be?

PBCLK = 80MHz
PWM = 20kHz

PWM = PBCLK / PRE / PR
PR = PBCLK/PWM/PRE
PR = 80E6 / 20E3 / 1
PR = 4000

We should set PR3 to 4000. This is less than 65,000 so it's a reasonable value.

2. PWM program. Write a program that uses your previous result to create a 20 kHz PWM
output on OC1 (with no fault pin) using Timer3. Set the duty cycle to 75%. Get the
following screenshots from your oscilloscope:

a. The OC1 waveform. Verify that this waveform matches your expectations.

b. The sensor voltage Vout.

Components I used:
 - bright red LED
 - phototransistor
 - 300 Ohm resistor hooked up to LED anode
 - 1M Ohm resistor hooked up to phototransistor emitter. got 
	V_R to be very close to 3.3V using this
 - 3.3V and GND hooked up to PIC32, not to NScope
 - 102 capacitor for damping oscillations


c. Now remove the 1 µF capacitor and get another screenshot of Vout. Explain the
difference from the previous waveform.

The difference between V_out with the capacitor, versus without, is that Vout is
a fairly noisy signal without the capacitor. This could be due to oscillations from
the wall current, or due to oscillations due to other things hooked up to the PIC32.
The capacitor damps the oscillations and "averages" out the variability of the signal.


Insert the 1 µF capacitor back into the circuit for the rest of the project.
